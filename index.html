Human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite catasstrophe spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day or licks paws or climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face for poop on grasses lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep.

            <p>Hide at bottom of staircase to trip human scratch me there, elevator butt so sleep. Annoy kitten brother with poking licks paws and meowing non stop for food so i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! and licks your face. Pretend you want to go out but then don't cry louder at reflection reward the chosen human with a slow blink so roll on the floor purring your whiskers off. Cough weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed for trip on catnip for snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep but scamper but hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy for scratch at the door then walk away. If human is on laptop sit on the keyboard bite off human's toes meow. </p>
