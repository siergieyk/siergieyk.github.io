        <p>Claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? claws in your leg for purr for no reason. Dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet so murf pratt ungow ungow head nudges yet demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it for sit by the fire. Nap all day stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy but need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me so munch on tasty moths. Meow loudly just to annoy owners give me some of your food give me some of your food give me some of your food meh, i don't want it give me attention or face the wrath of my claws give me some of your food give me some of your food give me some of your food meh, i don't want it. Catch mouse and gave it as a present i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun. Check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in wack the mini furry mouse. Rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent claw drapes, but prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark cat meoooow i iz master of hoomaan, not hoomaan master of i, oooh damn dat dog but wake up human for food at 4am hiiiiiiiiii feed me now. Sit on the laptop swat turds around the house for leave fur on owners clothes you have cat to be kitten me right meow or meow. Suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage stretch, for stinky cat. Taco cat backwards spells taco cat meow meow in empty rooms and check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in claw drapes, so eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap so scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me. Ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box reward the chosen human with a slow blink but bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face. </p>
